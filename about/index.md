## About

Hi there. I’m Tyler and I’ve been working as a software engineer doing web development, specifically front-end, for over ten years. I’ve always been in favor of sharing information and knowledge freely via open-source code, most notably <a href="https://www.cutestrap.com/" target="_blank">Cutestrap</a>. However, I haven’t figured out where I best fit into the overall in the web development community with regards to giving back.  

When I started doing web development, I was armed with simply a text editor and a web browser and able to learn from any website by inspecting their source code. I would browse the web and any time some cool thing caught my eye, I’d inspect it, investigate it, recreate it, improve it, and make it my own.  

While the tools to write, inspect, and debug code has evolved greatly in the past decade, it’s become much more difficult to learn from inspecting live code on a website. There are great resources, such as tutorials, videos, courses and full code repositories available for free, but none of them fully satisfy my learning style.  

I’m a tinkerer and I learn by poking, prodding, breaking and mending. This approach might not be for you, but I’m creating this knowing it would have helped me grow and learn ten years ago. The content here is designed and created in such a way to last long into the future by requiring zero dependencies other than a text editor and a web browser.  

All of the posts are focused on a single topic and aim to be clear, but not comprehensive. One of the greatest strengths of an engineer is knowing how to find answers. Knowing what to look for is the main challenge, so these posts aim to give enough context and information to help guide your searches.  

If this is your first time here and you’re new to web development, I recommend checking out the “Start Here” page. It’s the only tutorial on this site and will help you to understand how to tinker with the code examples better.
